This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## If you want to run the server in container, you can use the following command:
    
```bash
$ docker build -t frontend .
```
then
```bash
$ docker run -it -p 3000:3000 frontend
```
